# intrisically_curved_folds
The Python code is written for the compuation of relaxed shape of an intrisically curved fold, 
as part of the SI for the paper 'Geometry, mechanics and actuation of intrisically curved folds'. 

Three methods (1D finite element, theoretical shape under the thin and nearly-cylindrical assumption, ODE for far-from-cylindrical assumption)
are provided. The comparision is also shown at the end of the code.

One can change the inticial shape defined by: alpha1, alpha2, R0 and length.
